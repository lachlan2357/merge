/**
 * Build a pathway for a tag to be able to infer its value.

 *
 * 1. Assertions. Each assertion forms a check that must be true in order for this inference to be
 * able to be made. Some common assertions are provided as their own functions, such as
 * {@link InferenceBuilder.assertIsSet()}, {@link InferenceBuilder.assertIsEq()}, etc., however a
 * catch-all {@link InferenceBuilder.assertThat()} is provided for extended functionality.
 * 2. Inference Function. Given all the assertions to be true, an inference function is required
 * to transform the assertions into an inferred value.
 *
 * @template Tag The {@link MergeWayTag} which this creator is building for.
 * @template SetTags All tags this pathway requires to be present to evaluate an inference.
